# Intro

Application of digital technology to avionics
Started with radar in WW2.

In 60s and 70s jet fighters needed embedded systems.

Introduction of fly-by-wire: pilot gives inputs to a computer and computer operates actuators
e.g. EF cannot be operated manual.

Later moved to commercial AC by Airbus. Reduced 1 engineer in the cockpit

Today many other systems.

Man-machine interactions. one example watching for information overload andf filtering the info needed for the task, especially in critical situations
Other: servicing systems, infotainment, passager booking, check-in, etc

Synthesis between digital and aircraft technologies requiring systems engineering

Not yet the end of the story: 
* Big data AC collect a lot of data. Today we can analyze  the data sets and use the analysis for predictive maintenance, 
* AI to support the man-machine interface and take tasks independently. We can imagine autonomous with one supervisor
* blockchain: technology to record data distributedly so it cannot be changed later. Interesting for logistics and safety.
* platform companies:
synthesis between digital disciplines and classical ones to change how we produce, operate aircraft

# Digitalization in Production

Digital tech used in production since the 60s.

Production is the processes from customer requirements to shipment of goods:
- research and engineering to define the product
- production planning
- production contorl schedules all steps
- material scheduling procures parts and materials

* 1st industrial revolution: 18th century James Watt's steam engine driving a loom 
* 2nd industrial revolution: Taylor division of labor in mass production and automation. Separates WCW and BCW
* 3rd industrial revolution in 1960s: integrate computers in production facilities: robots and CNCs
* 4th industrial revolution: interlinked intelligent production systems ERP etc

industry 4.0 compells people to use IT. Many features, focus on 4:
* CPS cyber-physical production systems
* assistance systems
* digital twin
* robotics

# Cyber-Physical Systems

linking real objects and processes with information progcessing (virtual objeects and processes) via internet technology

e.g. operate car with a phone. 
CPS = embedded system + intelligent connectivity

In production they enable linking machines, decentralized control.
Potential revolution in production
Before: pyramid of automation with field, control, supervision, planning and managment levels
Now: network of connections provides better transparency enables flexibility, quality, increased use of production capacity
Needed new organization to allow automony.

4 abilities of CPS elements:
* spontaneous connectivity
* self description
* task-oriented programming: no code
* automatic device parametrization: sensors can adapt to the product

Examples: fiber-placement

# Digital Twin

**Digital models** are used for simulation since years for different things. In the last decade it was expended to the whole lifecycle. 

Now we can add data we collect during design, production, operation: **Digital shadow**. 

**Digital twin = digital model + digital shadow**. It accompanies the product through its complete life cycle.

Digital twin of a factory we call **Digital factory**

# Assistance Systems

Assistance systems provide support (cognitive, for perception or decision, or physical for execution) to humans in the increasingly complex production environment

# Robotics

Used in last 40 years but exciting recent developments.

conventionally: repetitive tasks, in fenced area, programming required expert knowledge. Not suitable for increased variability, smaller lot sizes, shorter product life cycle
Now: aware robots able to react and communicate with humans without expert knowledge enable cooperation with humans, flexible, intuitive no-code or low-code programming

Give tasks to the robots, no need to program every step. communicate with gestures, eye movement or speech recognition

Man and robot split the tasks: the robot takes non-ergonomic tasks

Mobile robots

# Conclusion
