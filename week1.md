# Intro

Application of digital technology to avionics
Started with radar in WW2.

In 60s and 70s jet fighters needed embedded systems.

Introduction of fly-by-wire: pilot gives inputs to a computer and computer operates actuators
e.g. EF cannot be operated manual.

Later moved to commercial AC by Airbus. Reduced 1 engineer in the cockpit

Today many other systems.

Man-machine interactions. one example watching for information overload andf filtering the info needed for the task, especially in critical situations
Other: servicing systems, infotainment, passager booking, check-in, etc

Synthesis between digital and aircraft technologies requiring systems engineering

Not yet the end of the story: 
* Big data AC collect a lot of data. Today we can analyze  the data sets and use the analysis for predictive maintenance, 
* AI to support the man-machine interface and take tasks independently. We can imagine autonomous with one supervisor
* blockchain: technology to record data distributedly so it cannot be changed later. Interesting for logistics and safety.
* platform companies:
synthesis between digital disciplines and classical ones to change how we produce, operate aircraft

# Digitalization in Production

Digital tech used in production since the 60s.

Production is the processes from customer requirements to shipment of goods:
- research and engineering to define the product
- production planning
- production contorl schedules all steps
- material scheduling procures parts and materials

* 1st industrial revolution: Watt 
* 2nd industrial revolution: Taylor separates WCW and BCW
* 3rd industrial revolution in 1960s: integrate computer in production facilities: robots and CNCs
* 4th industrial revolution: interlinked intelligent production systems
